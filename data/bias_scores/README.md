# Partisan Audience Bias Scores

These scores were derived from the sharing patterns of web domains by ~500K known Democrats and Republicans on Twitter. The scores scale from -1 (shared only by Democrats) to 1 (shared only by Republicans), and we excluded domains shared by less than 50 unique accounts. More details on the scores are available in our paper, which you can download [here](http://ronalderobertson.com/robertson2018auditing.pdf).

We provide our scores below for research purposes only. To prevent the potential for reidentification, all scores have been rounded to four digits past the decimal and we provide the number of tweets and unique accounts that shared a domain rounded to the nearest 100. We also provide the partisan bias scores from several other projects that we used to validate our scores.
